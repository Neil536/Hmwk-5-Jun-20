    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <br>
     <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a web page. HTML has tree structure consisting of branches and nodes.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML elements</h2>
    <br>
     <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags".</p>

    <h3>HTML tags
    <br>
     <p>Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML5, the current standard for HTML, has roughly 100 tags. Tags consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". Many browsers have default styles for the appearance of the document based on the meaning of the tag.</p>

    <h4>Text
    <br>
     <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.</p>
